the raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while latavius murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the afc in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. in comparison, the bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. david fales, punter patrick o'donnell, alshon jeffery, ka'deem carey, hroniss grasu, tackle jermon bushrod and nose tackle jeremiah ratliff were inactive. the raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. the bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via jay cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to eddie royal. during the drive, lineman charles leno landed on center will montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting matt slauson to replace him. robbie gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. after the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the raiders scored on carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. on the bears' next series, slauson botched the snap to cutler, and the raiders' dan williams recovered. oakland capitalized on the takeaway with roy helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the bears responded with cutler taking advantage of an open martellus bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. on oakland's next drive, carr's swing pass to murray was deflected and landed towards pernell mcphee, intercepting the pass; gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. in the second half, the raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after stacy mcgee recovered matt forte's fumble. oakland eventually took the lead with sebastian janikowski's 29-yard field goal. gould eventually gave the bears the lead back with gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with murray dropping a pitch and sam acho recovered. however, the bears gave the ball back when cutler's pass for bennett fell short and was intercepted by woodson, leading to janikowski's 41-yard field goal. with 2:05 left in the game, cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by forte, followed by a sack by mack and incomplete pass to josh bellamy to bring up fourth down, cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to bennett, who beat keenan lambert. cutler's next pass to marquess wilson fell incomplete, and forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to wilson with 56 seconds left. on the next set of downs, cutler's pass for receiver cameron meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to royal allowed the offense to enter oakland territory, where the bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. the offense entered field goal range with cutler's nine-yard pass to wilson, followed by a two-yard run by forte. with seven seconds left, the bears used another timeout, and allowed gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the bears the 22-20 lead. in an last-second attempt to score, the raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. gould was later named the nfc special teams player of the week, his third st potw honor and tying him with kickers jeff jaeger and paul edinger for the most in team history. the field goal was gould's eleventh career game-winner. forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in nfl history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. the win would be the only home win for the bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1-7 home record. the bears would finish 3-13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined.",
