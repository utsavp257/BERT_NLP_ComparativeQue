            "[CLS] who created the population factor e - e / kt? [SEP] in the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light ; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. a reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state ; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. the speed of a chemical reaction ( at given temperature t ) is related to the activation energy e, by the boltzmann's population factor e−e / kt – that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature t. this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the arrhenius equation [SEP]\n",

[SEP] multi - color leds offer not merely another means to form white light but a new means to form light of different colors. most perceivable colors can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. this allows precise dynamic color control. as more effort is devoted to investigating this method, multi - color leds should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color. however, before this type of led can play a role on the market, several technical problems must be solved. these include that this type of led's emission power decays exponentially with rising temperature, resulting in a substantial change in color stability. such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use. thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists.

            "[CLS] what creates wind, cyclones and anti - cyclones? [SEP] solar radiation is absorbed by the earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71 % of the globe – and atmosphere. warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. when the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the earth's surface, completing the water cycle. the latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti - cyclones. sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °c. by photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.

            "[CLS] most adult insects have adopted what kind of gait? [SEP] many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a tripedal gait. the tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in cockroaches. the legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. for the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. when they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. the purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. however, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. for example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.

[SEP] when the alloy cools and solidifies ( crystallizes ), its mechanical properties will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. a metal that is normally very soft and malleable, such as aluminium, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, like copper. although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will be much harder and stronger. adding a small amount of non - metallic carbon to iron produces an alloy called steel. due to its very - high strength and toughness ( which is much higher than pure iron ), and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment, steel is one of the most common alloys in modern use. by adding chromium to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel.

            "[CLS] what other reason did merton believe causes science to advance? [SEP] protestantism has had an important influence on science. according to the merton thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of english puritanism and german pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other. the merton thesis has two separate parts : firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology ; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th - century england and the religious demography of the royal society ( english scientists of that time were predominantly puritans or other protestants ) can be explained by a correlation between protestantism and the scientific values. merton focused on english puritanism and german pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. he explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic protestant values and those of modern science. protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify god's influence on the world — his creation — and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.

[SEP] about 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from antarctica, of which about 750 are non - lichen - forming and 400 are lichen - forming. some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the mcmurdo dry valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. the apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the mcmurdo dry valleys. in particular, their thick - walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to uv light. those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in antarctica. this has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on mars, it might have looked similar to antarctic fungi such as cryomyces minteri. some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to antarctica. endemic antarctic fungi also include certain dung - inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung [SEP]\n",

            "[CLS] which police force monitored karl marx? [SEP] historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross - border police missions for many years ( deflem, 2002 ). for example, in the 19th century a number of european policing agencies undertook cross - border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. a notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by prussian police of karl marx during the years he remained resident in london. the interests of public police agencies in cross - border co - operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in europe, which eventually led to the establishment of interpol before the second world war. there are also many interesting examples of cross - border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century ( nadelmann, 1993 ). it has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. it is also generally agreed that in the post – cold war era this type of practice became more significant and frequent ( sheptycki, 2000 ).
